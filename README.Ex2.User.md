## Exercise 2 is about forwarding to extract behaviour into another class

1. First I got the code from the example and wrote the retrospctive rspec spec file so that I could move forward
2. I ran the tests to make sure that code worked in its initial state
3. I then extracted the password functionality and encapsulated this in a class of its own
4. I made password an instance of the Password class and used the functionalty of that class in the code.
5. I then re-ran the rspec tests to ensure that the code retained the expected behaviour

Forwarding is the calling of method calls from other classes, i.e. classes in which the code is not defined.
(I think)
