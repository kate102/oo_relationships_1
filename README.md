## README Information

Each of the parts of this excercise differed from the last so I decided to 
keep the README easy to follow I would separate it into README's for 
specific exercises and objectives.

README.Ex1.Diary.md - 
  This is not only Exercise 1 but the Code from the Diode on 
  Encapsulation do this covers TDD and Encapsulation

README.Ex2.User.md - 
  This ws ablout forwarding behaviour

README.Ex4.Scramble.mb - 
  This was about Polymorphism

Each had aspects of each other and also inheritance.
